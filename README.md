# PythonWhat-Experiments
pythonwhat is a Python library (developed by DataCamp) that lets you verify Python code submissions and auto-generate meaningful feedback messages. Originally developed for Python exercises on DataCamp for so-called Submission Correctness Tests, but can also be used independently.

I write technical tutorials (on Data Science and Machine Learning) on a daily basis, hence I found `pythonwhat` to be genuinely useful.
This repository contains my experiments that I performed locally to have a good understanding of `pythonwhat`.
